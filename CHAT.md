To create a React component library with Vite, you can follow these steps:

Create a new project by running npm init or yarn init in your terminal.

Install Vite and React as dependencies by running npm install --save vite react or yarn add vite react.

Create a src directory and add a index.js file inside it. This file will be the entry point for your component library.

Create a package.json file in the root of your project and add the following fields:

Copy code
```ts
{
  "main": "src/index.js",
  "module": "src/index.js",
  "files": [
    "src"
  ]
}
```
Add a vite.config.js file in the root of your project with the following content:
Copy code
```ts
import { config } from 'vite';

export default config({
  jsx: 'react',
  rollup: {
    plugins: [
      require('rollup-plugin-node-resolve')(),
      require('rollup-plugin-commonjs')(),
    ],
  },
});
```
In the src directory, create a components directory and add your React components to it.

In the index.js file, export your components like this:

Copy code
```ts
export { default as Button } from './components/Button';
export { default as Input } from './components/Input';
// etc.
```
Run `npm run dev` or `y`arn dev` to start the development server and test your component library.

When you're ready to build your component library for production, run npm run build or yarn build to build a production-ready version of your library.

That's it! You should now have a working React component library built with Vite. You can publish it to npm or use it in your own projects.



-------------------------

To use Vite's library mode with code splitting in a React component library, you can follow these steps:

Create a new Vite project using the `create-vite-app` utility. Run npx create-vite-app my-app in your terminal to create a new Vite project.

Copy the src and vite.config.js files from your component library into the new Vite project.

In the vite.config.js file, set the library option to true:

Copy code
```ts
import { config } from 'vite';

export default config({
  library: true,
  // other options go here
});
```
In your component library, use the react-lazy component to code split your components. For example:
Copy code
```ts
import { lazy } from 'react';

const Button = lazy(() => import('./components/Button'));
```
Build your component library by running npm run build or yarn build. This will generate a production-ready version of your library in the dist directory.

To use your component library in another project, you can install it as a dependency using npm or yarn and then import your components as needed. For example:

Copy code
```ts
import { Button } from 'my-component-library';

function MyApp() {
  return <Button />;
}
```
That's it! Your component library should now be set up to use Vite's library mode and code splitting.

To create a simple React component library with Rollup and TypeScript, you can follow these steps:

Create a new project directory and initialize a package.json file by running npm init or yarn init.
Install the required dependencies by running 
```ts
npm install --save-dev @rollup/plugin-typescript @rollup/plugin-commonjs @rollup/plugin-node-resolve rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external rollup-plugin-size-snapshot rollup-plugin-terser react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
``` 

This will install Rollup, 
- the TypeScript plugin, 
- the CommonJS plugin,
 - the node resolve plugin,
 and 
 - the peer dependencies external plugin, 
 as well as the required dependencies for React.

Create a src directory and add a index.tsx file. This will be the entry point for your component library.

In the index.tsx file, create a simple React component, such as a button:

```ts
import React from 'react';

interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Button: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  return <button>{children}</button>;
};

export default Button;
```
Create a rollup.config.js file in the root of your project and add the following configuration:

```ts
import commonjs from '@rollup/plugin-commonjs';
import nodeResolve from '@rollup/plugin-node-resolve';
import peerDepsExternal from 'rollup-plugin-peer-deps-external';
import sizeSnapshot from 'rollup-plugin-size-snapshot';
import { terser } from 'rollup-plugin-terser';
import typescript from '@rollup/plugin-typescript';

const production = !process.env.ROLLUP_WATCH;

export default {
  input: 'src/index.tsx',
  output: [
    {
      file: 'dist/index.js',
      format: 'cjs',
      exports: 'named',
      sourcemap: true
    },
    {
      file: 'dist/index.es.js',
      format: 'es',
      exports: 'named',
      sourcemap: true
    }
  ],
  plugins: [
    peerDepsExternal(),
    typescript(),
    nodeResolve({ extensions: ['.tsx', '.ts'] }),
    commonjs(),
    production && sizeSnapshot(),
    production && terser()
  ]
};
```
This configuration will create a CommonJS and an ES module version of your component library in the dist directory.

 It will also enable the TypeScript plugin and the peer dependencies external plugin, which will handle the dependencies of your library.

Add a build script to your package.json file to run Rollup:

```ts
"scripts": {
  "build": "rollup -c"
}
```
Run `npm run build` or `yarn build` to build your component library.
To output the result as markdown for an article, you can use a tool like [Size Limit](https://github.com/ai/



---------------------

Create a scripts directory in the root of your project and 

add a `create-component.js` file.
In the `create-component.js` file, add the following code:
```ts
const fs = require('fs');
const path = require('path');

const componentName = process.argv[2];
const componentPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../src', componentName);

if (!componentName) {
  console.error('Error: You must provide a component name.');
  process.exit(1);
}

if (fs.existsSync(componentPath)) {
  console.error(`Error: The component ${componentName} already exists.`);
  process.exit(1);
}

fs.mkdirSync(componentPath);

const componentFile = path.resolve(componentPath, 'index.tsx');
fs.writeFileSync(
  componentFile,
  `import React from 'react';

const ${componentName}: React.FC = () => {
  return <div>${componentName}</div>;
};

export default ${componentName};`
);

console.log(`Successfully created component ${componentName}.`);

const rollupConfigPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '../rollup.config.js');
const rollupConfig = require(rollupConfigPath);

rollupConfig.input = [...rollupConfig.input, `src/${componentName}/index.tsx`];

fs.writeFileSync(
  rollupConfigPath,
  `module.exports = ${JSON.stringify(rollupConfig, null, 2)}`
);

console.log('Successfully added component to Rollup config.');
```
This script will take a component name as an argument, create a new directory for the component, create an index.tsx file for the component, and add the component's input configuration to the Rollup config.

Add a `create-component` script to your package.json file:

Copy code
```ts
"scripts": {
  "create-component": "node scripts/create-component.js"
}
```
Run the script with `npm run create-component` or `yarn create-component`, followed by the name of the component
 you want to create, 
 
> for example: npm run create-component Button or yarn create-component Button. 
 
This will create a new blank component named Button and add its input configuration to the Rollup config.
Keep in mind that this is just one way to automate the process of creating new components and adding them to the Rollup config. There are many other approaches you could take, depending on your specific needs and requirements.
